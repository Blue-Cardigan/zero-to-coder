# AI-Powered Development Tools Mastery Course
*A comprehensive hands-on guide for intermediate developers (2025)*

The landscape of AI-powered development tools has reached a critical inflection point in 2025. **Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and Cursor IDE represent the new foundation of modern development workflows** - offering capabilities that fundamentally transform how we write, debug, and maintain code. This course provides the comprehensive, practical knowledge intermediate developers need to master these tools and integrate them into production workflows.

## Core learning objectives

This course is designed around five integrated modules that build from basic tool usage to advanced workflow automation. **By completion, you'll have hands-on experience with each tool individually and understand how to combine them for maximum productivity gains**. The approach emphasizes practical application over theory, with every concept backed by real-world examples and working code.

The tools covered represent different approaches to AI-assisted development: Claude CLI for autonomous task execution, Gemini CLI for large-scale analysis with generous free access, MCP for extending AI capabilities, and Cursor IDE for comprehensive AI-native development environments. Understanding when and how to use each tool strategically is the key to maximizing their value.

## Module 1: Claude CLI mastery

### Installation and environment setup

Claude CLI emerged as Anthropic's premier coding assistant in February 2025, designed specifically for terminal-based development workflows. **The installation process requires Node.js 18+ and active billing through Anthropic Console**, making it a premium tool focused on serious development work.

**System requirements and installation:**
- macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+, or Windows via WSL
- 4GB RAM minimum, Node.js 18+
- Internet connection and supported country access

The installation process itself is straightforward but requires attention to security best practices:

```bash
# Install globally (never use sudo)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Navigate to project and start
cd your-project-directory
claude
```

Authentication happens through OAuth with console.anthropic.com, requiring active billing. The tool offers multiple subscription tiers: Anthropic Console (pay-per-use), Claude Pro ($20/month), Claude Max ($200/month), and Enterprise plans with AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI integration.

### Command syntax and core capabilities

Claude CLI operates through both interactive REPL mode and direct command execution. **The tool maintains awareness of entire codebases and can perform complex, multi-file operations autonomously**.

**Essential command patterns:**
```bash
# Interactive mode
claude

# Direct query
claude "explain this project's architecture"

# Continue recent conversation
claude -c

# Resume specific session
claude -r "session-id" "continue the refactoring"

# SDK mode for automation
claude -p "fix all TypeScript errors" --output-format json
```

**Advanced CLI flags provide fine-grained control:**
```bash
# Multi-directory support
claude --add-dir ../apps ../lib

# Tool permissions
claude --allowedTools "Bash(git log:*)" "Write"

# Model selection
claude --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Automation mode (use with caution)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Project configuration and workflows

The `CLAUDE.md` file serves as the project's instruction manual for Claude, providing persistent context that survives conversation resets. **This configuration is essential for consistent, high-quality results**.

**Sample CLAUDE.md structure:**
```markdown
# Project Guide for Claude

## Development Workflow
- Use TypeScript strict mode for all new code
- Run `npm run typecheck` before commits
- Follow existing naming conventions in the codebase

## Architecture Notes
- `src/auth/`: Authentication and authorization
- `src/api/`: RESTful API endpoints
- `tests/`: Test files using Jest

## Common Tasks
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Code Style Preferences
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use async/await over Promise chains
- Destructure imports when possible
```

### Real-world development scenarios

**Codebase exploration and Q&A:**
Claude CLI excels at understanding complex codebases and answering architectural questions. Unlike simple code completion tools, it can trace relationships across multiple files and explain system behavior.

```bash
claude "How does user authentication flow through this application?"
claude "What are all the database models and their relationships?"
claude "Show me potential security vulnerabilities in the API layer"
```

**Autonomous bug fixing:**
The tool can identify, analyze, and fix bugs across multiple files simultaneously, understanding context and maintaining consistency.

```bash
claude "Fix all the TypeScript errors in the src/ directory and ensure proper error handling"
claude "The login feature is broken - investigate and fix the issue"
claude "Optimize database queries that are causing performance problems"
```

**Test-driven development workflows:**
Claude CLI supports comprehensive TDD workflows, writing tests first and then implementing code to pass those tests.

```bash
# Step 1: Generate comprehensive tests
claude "Write thorough unit tests for the payment processing module, covering edge cases like network failures and invalid inputs"

# Step 2: Implement passing code
claude "Write the implementation to make all payment tests pass while maintaining security best practices"
```

### Git and GitHub integration

The GitHub app integration allows Claude to participate directly in development workflows through `@claude` mentions in PRs and issues. **This creates seamless automation for code reviews, bug fixes, and feature implementation**.

Installation requires setting up the GitHub app, after which Claude can:
- Analyze pull requests and provide code reviews
- Investigate and fix issues directly from GitHub issue comments
- Create commits with descriptive messages
- Resolve merge conflicts intelligently

```bash
claude "Create a meaningful commit message for my staged changes"
claude "Resolve the merge conflict in auth.js while preserving both sets of changes"
claude "Search git history to find when the performance regression was introduced"
```

### Advanced automation and CI/CD

Claude CLI's headless mode enables integration into automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines. **The tool can be scripted for batch operations while maintaining its sophisticated understanding of code**.

```bash
# Batch processing example
for file in *.py; do
  claude -p "Add comprehensive type hints to this file" < "$file" > "${file}.typed"
done

# CI/CD integration
claude -p "Review this PR for security issues and performance problems" --output-format json | your-analysis-tool
```

**Pipeline integration requires careful handling of API keys and rate limits**, but enables powerful automation capabilities like automated code reviews, documentation generation, and quality assurance checks.

## Module 2: Gemini CLI exploration

### Installation and configuration

Google's Gemini CLI launched in June 2025 as an open-source alternative with a **generous free tier providing 1-million token context window and 60 requests per minute**. This makes it particularly attractive for large codebase analysis and budget-conscious developers.

```

## Module 3: MCP protocol and Claude Desktop

### Understanding Model Context Protocol

MCP represents a fundamental architectural shift in AI system design. **Rather than building custom integrations for each data source, MCP provides a universal protocol that transforms the "M×N problem" into an "M+N problem"** through standardization.

**Core architectural concepts:**
- **Hosts**: AI applications (Claude Desktop, Cursor) that users interact with
- **Clients**: Protocol connectors within hosts (1:1 with servers)
- **Servers**: Services exposing capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation**: Stateful sessions with capability negotiation

The protocol defines three fundamental primitives:
1. **Tools**: Model-controlled functions requiring user approval
2. **Resources**: Application-controlled data sources for context
3. **Prompts**: User-controlled templates for complex workflows

### Claude Desktop setup and configuration

**Prerequisites and installation:**
- Claude Desktop (latest version) for macOS or Windows
- Node.js for most MCP servers
- Text editor for JSON configuration

**Configuration process:**
```bash
# Access configuration
# macOS: Claude menu → Settings → Developer → Edit Config
# Windows: Claude menu → Settings → Developer → Edit Config

# Configuration file locations:
# macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Basic server configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/Desktop"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",

### Custom MCP integration development

**Development environment setup:**
MCP provides SDKs for multiple languages, with Python and TypeScript being the most mature options.

**Python server development (FastMCP):**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import httpx
from typing import Any

# Initialize server
mcp = FastMCP("weather-server")

@mcp.tool()
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    try:
        # API integration logic
        response = httpx.get(f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}")
        data = response.json()
        return {"city": city, "weather": data}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

@mcp.resource("weather://current")
def current_weather_resource() -> str:
    """Current weather data resource."""
    return "Current weather information available"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

**TypeScript server implementation:**
```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Tool registration
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => ({
  tools: [{
    name: "process_data",
    description: "Process and analyze data",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        data: { type: "string" },
        operation: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  }]
}));

// Tool execution
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name === "process_data") {
    const { data, operation } = request.params.arguments;
    // Implementation logic
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: "Processing completed" }]
    };
  }
  throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${request.params.name}`);
});

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
server.connect(transport);
```

### Production deployment and security

**Security best practices:**
- OAuth 2.1 for remote server authentication
- Role-based access control implementation
- Environment variable credential storage
- Regular API key rotation
- Input validation and sanitization

**Error handling patterns:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def safe_database_query(query: str) -> dict:
    """Execute database query with comprehensive safety."""
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not validate_sql_query(query):
            return {"error": "Invalid or unsafe query detected"}
        
        # Execute with connection pooling
        result = db_pool.execute(query)
        return {"success": True, "data": result.fetchall()}
    
    except AuthenticationError:
        return {"error": "Database authentication failed"}
    except RateLimitError:
        return {"error": "Query rate limit exceeded"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Query execution failed: {str(e)}"}
```

**Performance optimization strategies:**
- Connection pooling for database servers
- Caching frequently accessed resources
- Asynchronous operation handling
- Memory management and cleanup

### Integration patterns and workflows

**Database development workflow:**
```python
@mcp.tool() 
def analyze_schema(database: str = "development") -> dict:
    """Analyze database schema and relationships."""
    schema_info = get_database_schema(database)
    return {
        "tables": schema_info.tables,
        "relationships": schema_info.foreign_keys,
        "indexes": schema_info.indexes,
        "recommendations": suggest_optimizations(schema_info)
    }
```

**API management integration:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def deploy_service(environment: str, version: str) -> dict:
    """Deploy API service to specified environment."""
    if environment not in ["staging", "production"]:
        return {"error": "Invalid deployment environment"}
    
    deployment = deploy_to_environment(environment, version)
    return {
        "deployment_id": deployment.id,
        "url": deployment.endpoint_url,
        "health_check": deployment.health_status
    }
```

## Module 4: Cursor IDE comprehensive guide

### Installation and environment configuration

Cursor IDE represents the next generation of AI-native development environments. **Built as a fork of VS Code, it integrates advanced AI capabilities directly into the core development experience** rather than adding them as extensions.

**System requirements and installation:**
- RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended, 16GB for large projects
- Storage: 1GB+ free disk space
- Network: Stable internet for AI model access
- OS: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Ubuntu 20.04+ LTS

**Installation process:**
```bash
# Download from cursor.com (~200MB)
# Windows: Run .exe installer
# macOS: Drag Cursor.dmg to Applications
# Linux: Make AppImage executable and run

# Initial configuration options:
# - Keyboard shortcuts (VS Code, Vim, Emacs)
# - Theme and language preferences
# - VS Code migration (one-click import)
# - CLI tool installation
```

### Core AI feature mastery

**Tab completion system:**
Cursor's proprietary completion models predict multi-line edits across files, understanding project context and recent changes. **The system goes beyond simple autocomplete to suggest complex refactoring patterns and cross-file modifications**.

**Chat interface (⌘+L):**
The chat system provides access to multiple AI models with full project context:
- GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro model selection
- @filename references for specific file context
- @Web integration for real-time information
- @Docs for custom documentation sources
- Image support for UI mockups and diagrams

**Inline editing (Ctrl/Cmd+K):**
Select code and describe desired changes in natural language. The system provides visual diff previews before applying changes, supporting everything from minor adjustments to complete function rewrites.

**Agent mode (⌘+I):**
Autonomous AI agents work independently on complex, multi-file tasks:
```bash
# Example agent tasks:
"Refactor the authentication system to use JWT tokens instead of sessions, updating all related files and tests"

"Add comprehensive error handling throughout the API layer with proper logging and user-friendly error messages"

"Implement responsive design for the dashboard component with mobile-first approach"
```

### Advanced development workflows

**Debugging and error resolution:**
Cursor provides intelligent debugging assistance that understands stack traces, identifies root causes, and suggests fixes across multiple files.

```typescript
// Example: Cursor can identify and fix complex async issues
async function problematicFunction() {
  // Cursor detects: missing error handling, race conditions, memory leaks
  const data = await fetchData();
  processData(data);
  return result; // Cursor suggests: proper error boundaries and cleanup
}
```

**Refactoring capabilities:**
The AI understands code structure and relationships, enabling safe refactoring across large codebases:
- Extract components while maintaining prop interfaces
- Rename variables with scope awareness
- Convert between different design patterns
- Update import/export statements automatically

**Testing integration:**
- Generate unit tests based on implementation
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Maintain test coverage during refactoring
- Execute tests with AI-generated explanations

## Module 5: Advanced Cursor rules system

### Rules architecture and implementation

The Cursor Rules system provides **persistent, reusable context that survives AI conversation resets**, acting as a permanent memory system for development preferences and standards. This represents a fundamental advancement over traditional LLM interactions.

**Modern rule system (2025):**
- **Project rules**: `.cursor/rules/` directory with .mdc files
- **User rules**: Global settings applied across all projects  
- **Legacy support**: .cursorrules files (deprecated but functional)

**Rule application types:**
- **Always**: Included in every AI interaction
- **Auto Attached**: Applied when files match glob patterns  
- **Agent Requested**: AI decides relevance based on description
- **Manual**: Explicitly referenced with @ruleName

### Rule creation and configuration

**Setup process:**
```bash
# Create rule directory structure
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/core
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/frontend
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/backend

# Automated installation
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Integrated workflows and tool combinations

### Strategic tool combination patterns

**Analysis → Implementation workflow:**
Use Gemini CLI's massive context window for codebase analysis, then switch to Claude CLI for implementation:
```bash
# Phase 1: Large-scale analysis
gemini
> @src/ analyze this entire codebase, identify architectural issues, and create a comprehensive refactoring plan

# Phase 2: Implementation
claude "Based on the analysis, implement the refactoring plan with proper error handling and tests"
```

**Development environment integration:**
Cursor IDE serves as the primary development environment, with CLI tools for specialized tasks:
- Cursor IDE: Daily development, debugging, code completion
- Claude CLI: Complex autonomous tasks, git operations  
- Gemini CLI: Large codebase exploration, documentation analysis
- MCP servers: External system integration, specialized tools

### MCP-powered workflow automation

**Custom development server:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def analyze_and_fix_issues(component: str) -> dict:

    """Deploy after comprehensive analysis."""
    # Pre-deployment checks

### Advanced debugging workflows

**Multi-tool debugging approach:**
1. **Cursor IDE**: Initial problem identification and code exploration
2. **MCP servers**: External system investigation (databases, APIs, logs)
3. **Claude CLI**: Root cause analysis and fix implementation
4. **Gemini CLI**: Large-scale impact analysis across codebase

**Example debugging session:**
```bash
# Step 1: Identify issue in Cursor IDE
# User reports authentication failures

# Step 2: MCP server investigation
# @database-server: Check authentication table for anomalies
# @log-server: Analyze error patterns in application logs
# @monitoring-server: Review performance metrics

# Step 3: Claude CLI analysis
claude "Based on the database anomalies and log patterns, identify the root cause of authentication failures and implement a fix"

# Step 4: Gemini CLI impact assessment  
gemini
> @src/ analyze the entire codebase for similar authentication patterns that might be affected by this issue
```
