# Welcome to Zero-to-coder


# Slide 1
## Before we start, make sure to have:
- An account on Github.com
- Cursor installed on your machine
- An account on Vercel.com

# Slide 2
## Session outline
===Part 1===
## Build and host your first website

===Part 2===
## Start your own project with custom features
### database, authentication, APIs

# Slide 3
===Part1===
1) Prompt Bolt.new. 
2) Develop in Cursor
3) Host on Vercel

# Slide 4
## Prompt a nice landing page
   1) Think of a project you want to build, then build the landing page for it.
   2) Ask questions about the code (to me or your preferred LLM).
   3) Don't be afraid of the code - click around and see what sense you can make of it.

# Slide 5 
# Open it in Cursor
   1) Export the files (at the top)
   2) Open the project in Cursor (In Cursor, File -> Open...)
   3) Ask in the chat on the right 'Get this project running'

# Slide 6
# Using Cursor (tips)
[] Add the current file to the chat with Cmd/Ctrl + A (Select All) > Cmd/Ctrl + L
[] If the agent starts looping, try:
   Regular chat with a specific instruction (Cmd/Ctrl + I)
   Use the latest model (not the Auto choice)
   Debug it yourself (It can make surprisingly stupid mistakes)
[] A small text-prompt appears below the chat input when the chat gets too long
[] Search all files in the codebase with Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F
[] Search for filenames with Cmd/Ctrl + P 

# Slide 7
# Play around adding functionality
    1) When it breaks, investigate.
    2) Frustrated? 
       1) Welcome to code! 
       2) The computer is only doing exactly what it's told
       3) Be curious, not frustrated
    3) Moving too fast? Formulate a question and ask an LLM
    4) Developers are always learning - the tools are endless

# Slide 8
# [Repeat cursor tips slide] 
+ [] You can add custom rules by clicking '@' in the Chat input, e.g 'I'm a beginner; explain everything"
+ [] Use the built in '@' + (e.g OpenAI/Django/NextJS) to find documentation without leaving Cursor

# Slide 9
Break

# Slide 10
===Part 2===
# New project, from scratch, in Cursor
AI Chatbot, or data visualization

## AI Chatbot: APIs, Authentication, Database
## Data visualization: A new (common) stack, also a database

# Slide 11
# Start in Cursor this time
Prompt Cursor with something like:
"Build me a chatbot to [...] using the OpenAI API"
"Build me a data visualization tool to Django/React to [...]"
# Extra Tip: Try a UI/UX prompt like "Make it premium and delightful"

# Slide 12
# What am I actually learning?
- Problem solving: Actual engineers rarely go into a project already knowing everything they need.
- I suggest chatting with another LLM in parallel to learn as you go
